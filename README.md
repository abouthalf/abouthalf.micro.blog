# Custom CSS for Mirco.Blog

Micro.blog allows for a custom CSS file to be added to any blog. I wanted to thoroughly customize the look of my site,
so I chose Micro.blog's `Default` theme, which is pretty minimal and doesn't include any Google fonts or other expensive assets.

I saved a local copy of the home page, the archives page, and a single post. I altered these to load my local CSS and the published "main" CSS from the hosted site. 

Then I could develop locally and see my changes against an accurate representation of the site.
